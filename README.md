# CSI3120A Programming Languages Concepts - Assignment 3

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation for Assignment 3 of the CSI3120A Programming Languages Concepts course. The aim is to develop a referencing environment builder for a simplified programming language, focusing on constructing a referencing environment for variable definition verification and redefinition detection.

## Objective
To finalize code for building a referencing environment using stack and linked list data structures. This involves constructing the environment for variable definition verification and redefinition detection.

## Tasks
1. **Referencing Environment**: Implement using LinkedList for the Symbol Table and functions for scope manipulation.
2. **Arithmetic Expression Evaluator**: Implement using Stacks for handling arithmetic expressions.
3. **Syntax Analyzer**: Integrate all components for a complete syntax analyzer.

## Testing
Validate the code with test cases, ensuring each input produces the expected output for scenarios including variable access, undefined variable errors, and variable value changes.
